## Introduction

RideChain is a decentralized application (dApp) for cab services, leveraging the power of blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and efficiency. By using Ethereum smart contracts, RideChain eliminates the need for intermediaries, allowing direct interaction between drivers and passengers.

## Features

- Decentralized booking and payment system
- Secure and transparent transactions using Ethereum blockchain
- Real-time ride tracking
- User authentication and profile management
- Rating and review system for drivers and passengers

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React Native
  - Expo

- **Backend:**
  - Next.js
  - Solidity
  - Ethereum blockchain

- **Others:**
  - Web3.js
  - IPFS for decentralized storage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Expo CLI installed
- Metamask extension for Ethereum transactions
- Truffle or Hardhat for smart contract development

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RideChain.git
   cd RideChain
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

1. **Start the Expo development server:**
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   expo start
   ```

2. **Deploy the smart contracts:**
   ```sh
   cd ../contracts
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

3. **Start the Next.js server:**
   ```sh
   cd ../backend
   npm run dev
   ```

```

## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts for RideChain are written in Solidity and manage the core functionality of the app, including:

- Booking management
- Payment processing
- User authentication

### Contract Deployment

To deploy the smart contracts, use Truffle or Hardhat. Ensure you have a local Ethereum node running or use a service like Infura.

```sh
truffle migrate --network development
```

### Contract Interaction

Use Web3.js to interact with the deployed contracts in your frontend and backend code.

## API Endpoints

The Next.js backend provides several API endpoints for interacting with the app:

- **POST /api/register** - Register a new user
- **POST /api/book** - Book a ride
- **GET /api/rides** - Get ride history
- **POST /api/review** - Submit a review
